Welcome to ICP1 Wiki, This is In Class Program session for CS5542 - BigData and Analytics Applications class. 

Goal of the session:
1. Download the Data from the following link into your google drive.a.https://umkc.box.com/s/y3niwfccpumnzbkyunwyznngb1xtd7a6
2.Mount the google drive to Google Colabnotebook and read the data using python Pandas library.
3.Perform 3 data analysis tasks on the data. 
4.Create the Github repository.
5.Save the Colab notebook in your Github repository. 


Steps Performed:
1. Downloaded the file from the link and uploaded to google colab datasets sections
2. imported some basic libraries like pandas and searborn and started to import and analyze data
3. Some Data analysis tasks performed are:
	a. Check the shape of the dataset
	b. Check if there are any columns with null values only and if yes deleted them
	c. Simple searborn count plot on diagnosis and check the variance in the dataset.
	d. Used seaborn heatmap to check if you can find any correlation between the feature columns 
4. Created a Github public repo called CS5542-Big-Data-Analytics-and-Applications
5. Saved the Collab file in Github in the newly created public repo.
